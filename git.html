- What git command creates a branch?
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
- What git command changes to another branch?
- What git command deletes a branch?
- How do merge conflicts happen?

The git command that creates a branch would be 'git checkout -b <new branch name>'.

The difference between a fast-forward and a recursive merge is that the fast-forward just moves the branch pointer
forward to include new commits from another branch. Recursice on the other hand will combine all the changes
from both branches. This means with fast-forward does not have a new commit, where recursive does.

To change another branch using git, we use 'git checkout <branch name>'.

To delete a branch we use 'git branch -d <branch-name>'

Merge conflicts happens when git cannot determine which changes to take. if there are many changes it will not be sure which take priority.
